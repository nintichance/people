* [Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/index.html)
* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) 
*[Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/): styled-components is a JS library which allows developers to easily style their React components. I style in styled-components because it keeps my CSS code more organized and readible.

**Third Goal Pseudo Code:**
Take the character count array from Display Characters and compare it to the other arrays
Declare a variable called count, which counts the number of similar elements in two arrays that are being counted
If two arrays have 90% of the same element makeup, then it is a repeat
To calculate 90% of the same element makeup
Take the length of each array being compared
Divide that number by two, giving you the average length between the two
Then take the count calculated and divided that by the average length
If the value returned is 90% or more, then it is a repeat.
Because there are no repeated email addresses in the data returned, I will test my
solution using a lower and lower percentage, 10%, 20%, 30%... and so forth
